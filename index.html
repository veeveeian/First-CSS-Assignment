    <p>Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection,<br> to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food.<br> Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment. Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue<br> representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another" and its vice representing human<br> moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. The word<br> "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts<br> that in English are denoted as "love"; one example is the plurality of Greek concepts for "love" (agape, eros, philia, storge) </p>
