<p>FUTO, as the Oldest University of Technology in Nigeria, was established in 1980 by Executive fiat with the composition and appointment of the first provisional Council by Nigeria’s First Executive President, Shehu Shagari. It became the first of three such Universities set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria who sought to establish a University of Technology in each geo-political region and particularly in a State which did not have a conventional University. On November 28, 1980, in the premises of the Old Government Technical College (GTC), FUTO opened its doors to staff and students. In January 1982 the Imo State government approved a permanent site for the University.  FUTO engaged Messrs Concarplan – Enplan Group (a firm of Consultants) to design the physical plan for the University.</p>
